# Hazards and continuous notation

Useful reading:

* Wachter, Chapter 3, "Cohort Mortality", especially section 3.4.

* Preston et al., Chapter 3, "The Life Table and Single Decrement
  Processes", especially 3.8, Mortality as a Continuous Process. 


Before discussing mortality, let's consider population growth. A
population that grows at rate $R_1$ in year 1, $R_2$ in year 2,
... $R_T$ in year T will have size

$$
N(T) = N(0)e^{R_1} e^{R_2} \ldots $e^{R_N}
$$

Using the rules of exponents
$$
N(T) = N(0) e^{\sum_1^T R_i}
$$

In continuous notation we can express the same thing as
$$
N(T) = N(0) e^{\int_0^T R(t)\,dt}
$$

We can use the same approach to model cohort mortality. We start with
$\ell(0)$ individuals born, who are exposed at age $a$ to mortality at rate
$h(a)$. Then, the fraction alive at age $x$ is
$$
\ell(x) = \ell(0) e^{-\int_0^x h(a)\,da}
$$

The equations for population growth and cohort survivorship look very
similar. The differences are that we have replaced $R(t)$ with $h(a)$
and we have inserted a minus-sign before the sum of cohort hazards. We
do this because we define mortality rates as positive numbers that
decrement the size of the cohort.

Q1.1 A population shrinking at an exponential rate of 5 percent would
after 20 years have which of the following sizes (as a fraction of
it's starting size)

A. exp(-.05 * 20) = exp(-1) = 0.37
B. 0
C. exp(-.05) = 0.95
D. -1
```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.1 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.1)
```


Q.2 If hazards were constant at 1/20, then at age 20 the fraction of a
cohort surviving would be
A. 0
B. exp(-1) = exp(- 20 * 1/20) = 0.37
C. exp(-1/20) = exp(- 1 * 1/20) = 0.95
D. 1
E. -1
```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.2 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.2)
```




We just wrote survivorship in terms of hazards. To write hazards in
terms of survivorship, we rearrange, take logs, and differentiate both
sizes. Letting $\ell(0) = 1$, this gives
$$
h(x) = -{d \over dx} \log \ell(x),
$$
where $\log$ is the natural logarithm.

This tells us that hazards are "minus the slope of log survivorship".

Let's verify this with the Human Mortality Database period life table
for 1900

```{r}
## needs proper path on our server
df <- read.table("/data/BWFD21/HMD/SWE/bltper_1x1.txt",
                 header = T, skip = 2)
s = df$Year == "1900"
x = 0:110
radix = 100000
lx = df$lx[s]/radix
mx = df$mx[s]
```

Let's look at the single-year-of-age mortality rates
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(x, mx)
plot(x, log(mx))
```

Q1.3 Over what age range do log hazards seem to rise linearly?
A. 0 to 20
B. 60 to 90
C. 30 to 60
```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.3 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.3)
```



Now let's compute an estimate of hazards as minus the slope of log
survival
```{r}
hx.hat = -diff(log(lx))
plot(x, mx, type = "l")
lines(0:109, hx.hat, lty = 2, col = "red")
```
We see that this basically works, except at the very old ages. This
looks like it's due to rounding error. Inspecting the results:
```{r}
names(lx) <- x
tail(lx, n = 20)
```
You can see that above age 95 or so there are very few significant
digits for the number of survivors..

Note: Preston has a nice summary table (page 69) of life table
quantities in continuous notation.

## Life expectancy

In continuous notation, life expectancy at age $x$ 
$$
e(x) = {\int_x^\infty \ell(a)\,da \over \ell(x)}
$$
and at age 0 is just
$$
e(0) = \int_0^\infty \ell(a)\,da.
$$

(Note: if nothing is said about the value of $\ell(0)$, you can just
let it equal 1.0. This makes $\ell(x)$ directly interpretable as a
fraction of the initial birth cohort.)

Another useful quantity is the sum of hazards up to age $x$, or
"cumulative hazards", which is denoted with a capital "H", 
$$
H(x) = \int_0^x h(a)\, da.
$$

Let's recalculate life expectancy for 1900 in Sweden using our
estimated hazards.

```{r}
hx.hat = -diff(log(lx))
Hx.hat = cumsum(hx.hat) ## the cumulated sum; cumsum(1:3) gives [1] 1 3 6
lx.hat = c(1, exp(-Hx.hat)) ## we use 1 for l(0)
lx.hat[is.nan(lx.hat)] <- 0
## for accuracy we sum person-years lived from x to x+ 1, known as Lx, rather than lx.
lxp1.hat = c(lx.hat[-1],0) ## l(x+1)
Lx.hat = (lx.hat + lxp1.hat)/2 ## Lx = [l(x) + l(x+1)] / 2
e0.hat = sum(Lx.hat)
## alt.e0.hat = sum(lx.hat) ## ignore for now
```

Let's compare to the published value
```{r}
hmd.e0 = df$ex[df$Year == 1900 &  df$Age == "0"]
print(c("hmd" = hmd.e0, "hat" = e0.hat))
```
The two estimates are super close!

Before finishing this section let's write a function to calculate e0
from hazards.
Note: Lx can be understood as Person Years Lived, or the area under the lx curve
```{r}

get.e0 <- function(hx)
{
Hx = cumsum(hx) ## the cumulated sum; cumsum(1:3) gives [1] 1 3 6
lx = c(1, exp(-Hx)) ## we use 1 for l(0)
## for accuracy we sum person-years lived from x to x+ 1, known as Lx, rather than lx.
lxp1 = c(lx[-1],0) ## l(x+1)
Lx = (lx + lxp1)/2 ## Lx = [l(x) + l(x+1)] / 2
e0 = sum(Lx, na.rm = T)
return(e0)
}
## test
get.e0(hx.hat)
```

Answer the following question by inserting `alt.e0 = sum(lx)' in the
R-code chunk above.

Q1.4 If we sum $l(x)$ rather than $L(x)$, we will
A. Get nearly exactly the same thing
B. Get a life expectancy value 0.5 years higher
```{r}
##  "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
answer1.4 = NA
quiz.check(answer1.4)
```

# Effect of sudden increase in hazards at all ages on life expectancy

If we increase the mortality rate by 10 percent at all ages, then what will happen
to life expectancy?

We can use our function to see.

```{r}
hx.shock = hx.hat * 1.1
e0.shock = get.e0(hx.shock)
e0 = get.e0(hx.hat)
absolute.change = e0.shock - e0
proportional.change = (e0.shock - e0)/e0
print("absolute.change")
print(absolute.change)
print("proportional.change")
print(proportional.change)
```

So, the result of a 10 percent increase in mortality rates at all ages
is that life expectancy falls from about 52.2 to about 50.1, an
absolute decline of a bit more than 2 years and a proportional change
of about 4 percent.

If we think about this as an elasticity, telling us the relative
change in y of a relative change in x, then the elasticity of life
expectancy with respect to a proportional change in mortality would be
about -0.4.

Exercises (Hint: you should be able to do all of these by making some
           minor modifications of the code that is in the notebook.
		   Another Hint: change the command "s = df$Year == 1900".)

1. Get the hazard schedule of the period life table a century later,
   in 2000 (Hint: think of hazards as the instantaneous mortality         rate). Plot hx and log(hx). For what age range does mortality          appear linear in the log scale?
   (Answer: Josh guesses without looking at the results it's pretty
   linear from age 40 to  90? Note: Josh may be wrong.)

2. Calculate life expectancy at birth using the function get.e0() and
   your hazard rates for 2000. Do you get close to the published
   number? (You should :)
   
3. Calculate life expectancy at birth for the life table with hazards
   10 percent higher at every age than that of the 2000 life table. 
   
   a) How many years does life expectancy decline as a result of the
   10 percent shock? Is this bigger or smaller than the effect in 1900
   of the same proportional shock?
   
   b) What is the elasticity of life expectancy with respect to such a
   shock? That is, what is the proportional decline in life expectancy
   relative to the proportional increase in mortality? Did this
   elasticity (which is known as "life table entropy") increase or
   decrease from 1900 to 2000?
   
   c) On Twitter, I got into a discussion with Ilya about whether if
   expectancy was really "the best way" to standardize the effects of
   Covid-19. [link is here](https://twitter.com/jrgoldstein1/status/1384265783623110656). 
   What do you think? Who is right? Who is wrong?   What does this
   have to do with changes in entropy?
   
Congratulations! You have finished the pre-workshop notebook on
mortality.
